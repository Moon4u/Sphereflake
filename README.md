This is ray tracing implementation of the Sphereflake fractal as described by Eric Haines here: http://www.realtimerendering.com/resources/SPD/
The implementation uses threads and SIMD. No shading is done.

Libraries used: SDL2 (for window creation and events) and glew (for opengl).
Both were obtained via vcpkg.
